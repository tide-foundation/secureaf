# SecureAF - Vibe Coded. Provably Secure.

After seeing [this](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/10-women-sued-tea-app-photos-hacked-leaked-online-rcna222880), quickly followed by [this](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/a-rival-tea-app-for-men-is-leaking-its-users-personal-data-and-drivers-licenses/), we wanted to see if we could vibe code this with the provably security of [this](https://tidecloak.com). Turns out, you can.

Should you actually use it? Hell No! We did this in 20 min and never tested it. What's wrong with you?
